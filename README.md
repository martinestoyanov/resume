# Welcome!

You've reached the backend of my resume!
The resume was created using the [JSONResume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard and the [theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-flat-projects) was modified to better suit my current information.
The theme was also updated to match the most current version of the [jsonresume-theme-boilerplate](https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-theme-boilerplate) and include HBS partials.
